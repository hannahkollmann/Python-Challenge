# Python-Challenge
During this challenge, we enter the world of programming with Python. Two Python challenges are completed: PyBank and PyPoll.

PyBank:
In this Challenge, we are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. A Python script is created that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
1) The total number of months included in the dataset
2) The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3) The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
4) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5) The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll: 
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. A Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values is created:
1) The total number of votes cast
2) A complete list of candidates who received votes
3) The percentage of votes each candidate won
4) The total number of votes each candidate won
5) The winner of the election based on popular vote
